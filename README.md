# CurrencyConverter
Project Overview:
Create a Currency Converter web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to input an amount in one currency and convert it to another currency based on real-time exchange rates.

Project Features:
User Interface:

Design a clean and user-friendly interface with input fields for the amount, dropdowns for selecting the source and target currencies, and a button to perform the conversion.
Display the result of the conversion prominently.
Currency Selection:

Include a dropdown or a list of currencies for both the source and target currencies.
Use a reliable API or a predefined set of exchange rates for conversion.
Conversion Logic:

Write JavaScript functions to handle the conversion logic.
Fetch real-time exchange rates from an API (e.g., free currency conversion APIs) or use static rates.
Conversion Trigger:

Implement a button or an event listener that triggers the conversion when clicked.
Display loading indicators during the conversion process.
Result Display:

Show the converted amount along with the selected currencies.
Include clear labels and formatting for better user understanding.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input or issues with the API request.
Display informative messages to guide the user.
Styling:

Use CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the application.
Consider using icons or flags for different currencies.
Implementation Steps:
HTML Structure:

Create the basic HTML structure with input fields, dropdowns, and buttons.
CSS Styling:

Apply styles to the HTML elements for a visually appealing layout.
JavaScript Logic:

Write JavaScript functions to handle the conversion logic.
Use event listeners to trigger the conversion.
API Integration (Optional):

If using real-time exchange rates, integrate a free currency conversion API.
Testing:

Test the application with different input scenarios to ensure accuracy.
Test on various browsers and devices for cross-browser compatibility.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to use the application and any dependencies.
Technologies Used:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
Resources:
Currency conversion API (if using real-time rates)
Flags or currency icons (optional for visual enhancement)
This project is a great way to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as understand the basics of working with APIs for real-time data. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to focus on user interface design and user experience.
